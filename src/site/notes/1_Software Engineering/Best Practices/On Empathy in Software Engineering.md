# On EmpathyÂ in Software Engineering

Think about your team-members and the developers that have to touch your code after you are done with it. There is no need to write fancy syntax and show off. The best code is the code that can be maintained easily and is easily understood by others.
Empathy is not only important in writing code but also in writing PR comments.

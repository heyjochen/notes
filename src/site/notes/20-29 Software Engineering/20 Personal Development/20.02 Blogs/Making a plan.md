One of the most important skills of an engineer is to break problems down and knowing how to tackle them. To do this it helps to take notes.

When getting a ticket assigned, start a note document and note the following things:

1. Goal
2. Tasks
3. Open Questions

By writing out these things, you are actively thinking about them which means you are proactive.

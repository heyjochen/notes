# How to increase your value as a Software Engineer

Generate high business value by learning to tackle ambiguous problems and helping unblock others at scale.

- 1-2 LC a day,
- read System Design books
- understand the bigger picture of a company
- know how you fit in
- go to conferences and network
- contribute to OSS

- flush out resume and website

Success is not directly related to your technical skillset, a lot of it goes beyond and relates to soft skills and office politics. How well can you communicate with your manager and project stakeholders?

Become really good at quickly learning business logic and how to design and build systems and software that align the best with business objectives.

Be a able to join a team and quickly orient and understand how your team's output works

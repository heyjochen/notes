# Observer Pattern

> [!NOTE]
> The Observer Pattern is a Design Pattern which consists of an Observable and an Observer. The Observable handles **emitting** events, whenever the underlying data changes, whereas the Observer handles the emitted data. This is done in the form of subscriptions, with the Observer **subscribing** to the Observable.

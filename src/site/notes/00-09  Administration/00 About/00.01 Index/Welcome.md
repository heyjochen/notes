# Welcome

> [!info] Info
> Welcome to my collection of notes, thoughts and summaries. My way of tracking things related to Software Engineering. **This is not a blog**, consider it more like a sketchbook, a constantly evolving blob of some kind.

## Who am I?
I am a Software Developer working out of Chicago, IL, constantly pursuing self-improvement. My interests include [keyboards](https://bastardkb.com/), [pizza](https://www.pizzamaking.com/forum/), and [large-format photography](https://www.largeformatphotography.info/forum/).
## What is this?
It's a form of Personal Knowledge Managementâ€”a workflow and system that originates from curiosity and brings me closer to the goal of becoming a better Software Engineer.
## What tools do I use?
I read through variety of resources and have developed a workflow that looks like this (at least for Blogs):

- Gather articles via [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/)
- Send articles via [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/en/) to my [Kobo](https://www.kobo.com/) e-reader
- Mark favorites in my Kobo to revisit later
- Take notes on those favorites via [Obsidian]() in a loose [ZK](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/) workflow paired with Johnny Decimal
- Refine, revisit, improve, publish
## How did I create this?
- Obsidian
- [Obsidian Digital Garden Plugin](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/)
- Markdown
- Netlify
## What am I reading currently?
- [[20-29 Software Engineering/20 Personal Development/20.01 Books/On Writing Well\|On Writing Well]]

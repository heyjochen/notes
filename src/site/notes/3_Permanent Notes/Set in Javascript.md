# Set in Javascript

A Set in Javascript keeps track of values and only stores unique values. 

```javascript
const arr = [0,1,1,1,2,3]
const set = new Set([...arr])
console.log(set)
```

Sets are great to keep track of active Filter Badges or of loading / fetching states when making requests to external data sources.

## Methods
### add()
Adds an entry in a Set and takes the entry as argument
### delete()
Removes a specified entry from the Set
### has()
Returns a boolean depending on the value existing or not in the Set

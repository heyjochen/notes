## Who am I?
- Software Developer working out of Chicago, IL
- Constantly pursuing self-improvement
- Interested in [keyboards](https://bastardkb.com/), [pizza](https://www.pizzamaking.com/forum/), and [large-format photography](https://www.largeformatphotography.info/forum/)
## What is Knowledge Management?
Knowledge Management is curiosity and curiosity is the tool that brings me closer towards the goal of becoming a better Software Engineer. Due to an endless stream of information, I rely on a bulletproof toolset to decipher to *really* benefit from it.
## What tools do I use?
I read through variety of resources and have developed a workflow that looks like this (at least for Blogs):

- Gather all posts via [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/)
- Send selected posts to [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/en/) to read them on my [Kobo](https://www.kobo.com/)
- Mark favorites in my Kobo to revisit later
- Take notes on those favorites via [Obsidian]() and the [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/) workflow developed by the German sociologist [Niklas Luhmann](https://niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/nachlass/zettelkasten). I use of templates, tags and the dataview plugin to organize my notes into "buckets"
- Refine, revisit, improve, publish
## What is this ugly color-scheme?
It's called [Gruvbox Material](https://github.com/sainnhe/gruvbox-material)and is a modified version with an adjusted contrast in order to protect your eyes during long days on your machine. I use it both in Obsidian as well in my dev-environment.
## How did I create this?
- Obsidian
- [Obsidian Digital Garden Plugin](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/)
- Written in Markdown
- Hosted on Netlify

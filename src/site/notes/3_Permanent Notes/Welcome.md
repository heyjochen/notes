# Welcome

> [!info] Info
> I started my journey into Knowledge Management and note taking mid-2023, after realizing, that I needed a better way of keeping track of all the things learned and read about when it comes to Software Engineering.

## Who am I?
- Software Developer working out of Chicago, IL
- Constantly pursuing self-improvement
- Tinkering with a bunch of different pizza recipes / tools
- Typing on a 34-key split Keyboard by [BastardKB](https://bastardkb.com/)
## What is Knowledge Management?
Knowledge Management is curiosity and curiosity is the tool that brings me closer towards the goal of becoming a better Software Engineer. Due to an endless stream of information, I rely on a bulletproof toolset to decipher to *really* benefit from it.
## What tools do I use?
I read through variety of resources and have developed a workflow that looks like this (at least for Blogs):

- Gather all posts via [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/)
- Send selected favorites to [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/en/) to read them on my [Kobo](https://www.kobo.com/)
- Take notes via [Obsidian]() and the [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/) workflow developed by the German sociologist [Niklas Luhmann](https://niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/nachlass/zettelkasten)
- Refine, revisit, improve, publish
## How did I create this?
- Obsidian
- [Obsidian Digital Garden Plugin](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/)
- Written in Markdown
- Hosted on Netlify

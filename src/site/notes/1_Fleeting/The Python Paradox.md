# The Python Paradox
[[Paul Graham\|Paul Graham]] 2004:
If companies want to hire best talent it can be beneficial choosing a language that only those pick up that care enough to learn it. Same goes for engineers: Get a good job by learning a language no one wants to learn.

While I do see the authors point and while this might have been valid in 2004, I don't consider Python an *esoteric* language. There has been steady adoption of the language especially in data related computing.
I did enjoy reading about the analogy of a sculptor moving around blobs of clay.

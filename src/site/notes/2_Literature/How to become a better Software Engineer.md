## What is the most important skill for software engineers according to the author?
The ability of not writing code. Not only is writing code expensive, maintaining code as well as refactoring can be even more effective. The best engineers know when to not write code or when code is to convoluted and needs to be simplified.
### What is the role of complexity in all of this?
Complex code is code that is hard to be picked up by others. Therefore it takes more time which in the end means a higher cost of maintaining.
### How does this relate to empathy?
Empathy is to think of others. How hard will it be for your team mates to take care of your mess?

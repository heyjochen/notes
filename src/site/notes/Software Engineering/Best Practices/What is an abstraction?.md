# What is an abstraction?

> [!DEFINITION]
> An Abstraction is the simplification of complex ideas to focus on the most critical aspects, thus to be able to understand patterns and principles more effectively.

> [!Tip]
>  From its roots, _abstraction_ should mean basically "something pulled or drawn away". So _abstract_ art is art that has moved away from painting objects of the ordinary physical world in order to show something beyond it. Theories are often abstractions; so a theory about economics, for instance, may "pull back" to take a broad view that somehow explains all of economics (but maybe doesn't end up explaining any of it very successfully). An _abstract_ of a medical or scientific article is a one-paragraph summary of its contentsâ€”that is, the basic findings "pulled out" of the article.

## Questions
- Why do we even need abstractions? Shouldn't we have code that is concise and easy to understand?
- Is it possible to over-abstract, if so how does that look?

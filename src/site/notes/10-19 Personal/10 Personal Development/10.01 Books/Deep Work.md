# Deep Work
*Deep work* refers to the ability to focus without interruption on a cognitively demanding task. Newport emphasizes the importance of creating a conducive work environment, embracing boredom, and managing technology use.

One of the things I liked most was his advice related to answering emails. He emphasizes to take your time and writing your response with a *process-centric approach* in mind. 
Avoid jargon, unnecessary bloated sentences and get straight to the point with a clear call to action. If needed provide specific time-slots for a call/meeting.

# So good they can't ignore you
Similarly to his book *Deep Work* this book does provide some value but could have been trimmed down by a *lot*. I found the amount of repetition and bloat to be annoying and had to skip paragraphs at times.

Still, there was some value for me in this book:
- The idea of becoming the Purple Cow
- The Research Bible Routine
- His mission-development system
## Become the Purple Cow
Strive for uniqueness and innovation. You should be remarkable and stand out from the competition, attract attention and create a memorable impression on the audience. 
This concept emphasizes the importance of creativity, differentiation, and being bold in order to thrive in a crowded marketplace.
## The Research Bible Routine
Start a document titled *Research Bible* (or whatever) and summarize an article, blog post, framework, idea, paper or anything else that interests you in your profession. The summary must include a description, how it compares to other work, and the main strategies. Those summaries should be a holistic overview and not a in-depth exploration. Only that way you are able to them do once a week.
### Cal Newports *mission-development* system
A three level pyramid.
#### Top Level: The Tentative Research Mission
A rough guideline for the type of work I'm interested in doing. In order to identify this mission description you need career capital in your field.
#### Bottom Level: Background Research
Every week you expose yourself to something new in your field (re: Research Bible). According to Steven Johnson (author of *Where good ideas come from*), access to new ideas and to the liquid networks that facilitate their mixing and matching often provides the catalyst for new breakthrough ideas.
#### Middle Level: Exploratory projects
This is responsible for most of the work. Create small projects (*little bets*) that can be completed in less than a month. These force you to create new value and produce a concrete result that you can use to gather feedback.
Keep deadlines and track your hours spent to hold yourself accountable.
Use the concrete feedback to drive your research forward.
